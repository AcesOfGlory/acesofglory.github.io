# Development Tools

### Text Editors:

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - My favourite text-editor which I am currently using. The premium version has a lot more advantages than the free version which has some limitations. There are so many very useful commands which aid in modifying code that save hassle and time.
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) - Amazing free text-editor useful for people who are less familiar with text-editors. If you are new or you don't want to pay for a text-editor, I highly recommend Atom.
- [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/)
- [Komodo Edit/IDE](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide)
- [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) - Okay text-editor for Java, not the biggest fan. 

- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - Pretty good text-editor used for Python. I prefer it to the original Python IDLE since it's easier to modify code. It doesn't, however, have that many useful commands that save time.

### Software Planning & Management:

- [Waffle](https://waffle.io/)
- [Trello](https://trello.com/)
- [Prose](http://prose.io/)

### Web Frameworks:
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) â€“ Python
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - Ruby
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - JavaScript & Sass

### Other:

- [Twine](http://twinery.org/) - An open-source tool for making interactive stories and games. Very easy learning curve, lots of fun.
- [Sortingh.at](http://www.sortingh.at/) -  Tool that gives personalized resources to help get started making games.
- [Icon generators](http://www.icongenerators.net/index.html) - Make cool avatars and icons, like the ones I am using in this blog.
