# Development Tools

### Text Editors:

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - My favourite text-editor which I am currently using. The premium version has a lot more advantages than the free version which has some limitations. There are so many very useful commands which aid in modifying code that save hassle and time.
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) - Amazing free text-editor useful for people who are less familiar with text-editors. If you are new or you don't want to pay for a text-editor, I highly recommend Atom.
- [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/)
- [Komodo Edit/IDE](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide) - My first IDE, very useful. 
- [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) - Okay text-editor for Java, not the biggest fan. 

- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - Pretty good text-editor used for Python. I prefer it to the original Python IDLE since it's easier to modify code. It doesn't, however, have that many useful commands that save time.

- [oXygen XML](https://www.oxygenxml.com/)
- [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/)
- [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/)
- [XMLSpy](http://www.altova.com/xmlspy.html)
